intuitive and optimized software for Dose calculations.

It's a self-declared [TG-114](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.3521473) compliant software that can be used for both, calculation and revision
of TPS reported doses in RT treatments. Its a team's member aim, to declare it compliant with
[DICOM](dicom.nema.org) standard in a not-so-far future release.

CheckDoseQt is mainly written in CXX-11, but we don't know what the future prepare for us.
In development stage, its functionalities are being tested with real data.
